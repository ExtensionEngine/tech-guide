# Performance Testing - Antipattern Examples

## Antipattern 1: Ignoring Think Time

Excluding think time between user actions can result in unrealistic performance metrics for certain types of tests, such as average, stress, and soak tests. However, think time is less critical for tests like breakpoint and spike tests, as other parameters can control these scenarios effectively. Incorporating think time is crucial when simulating real user behavior based on user scenarios. In the provided example, user actions are executed without any delay, which does not accurately reflect real-world conditions for this type of test.

```javascript
export default function () {
  http.get('http://example.com/api/resource1');
  http.get('http://example.com/api/resource2');
  http.get('http://example.com/api/resource3');
}
```

### Solution

Introduce think time between user actions to simulate real user behavior. This example adds a random delay between 1 to 5 seconds between each request. The bigger the range, the more realistic the simulation.

```javascript
import { randomIntBetween } from 'https://jslib.k6.io/k6-utils/1.4.0/index.js';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  http.get('http://example.com/api/resource1');
  sleep(randomIntBetween(1, 5));
  http.get('http://example.com/api/resource2');
  sleep(randomIntBetween(1, 5));
  http.get('http://example.com/api/resource3');
}
```

## Antipattern 2: Lack of Data Variation

Using static, hardcoded data for requests can cause caching mechanisms to produce artificially high performance metrics. In this example, the same username is used for every request, which may not represent real-world scenarios.

```javascript
export default function () {
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    username: 'username', // Static username used in every request
    password: 'password',
  });

  http.post('http://example.com/api/login', payload);
}
```

### Solution

Use dynamic data or randomization to simulate different user scenarios. This example generates a random username for each request.

```javascript
import exec from 'k6/execution';

export default function () {
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    username: `username${exec.vu.idInTest}`, // Unique identifier for each virtual user, we will use it to be sure every username is unique
    password: 'password',
  });

  http.post('http://example.com/api/login', payload);
}
```

## Antipattern 3: Not Scaling Virtual Users

Running performance tests with unrealistic numbers of virtual users or ramping up too quickly can lead to inaccurate results. In this example, the test starts with 1000 VUs immediately.

```javascript
export const options = {
  vus: 1000,
  duration: '1m',
};

export default function () {
  http.get('http://example.com/api/resource');
}
```

### Solution

Executors control how K6 schedules VUs and iterations. The executor that you choose depends on the goals of your test and the type of traffic you want to model. For example, the `ramping-vus` executor gradually increases the number of VUs over a specified duration, allowing for more realistic load testing for specific test types.

```javascript
export const options = {
  discardResponseBodies: true,
  scenarios: {
    contacts: {
      executor: 'ramping-vus',
      startVUs: 0,
      stages: [
        { duration: '20s', target: 10 },
        { duration: '10s', target: 0 },
      ],
      gracefulRampDown: '0s',
    },
  },
};

export default function () {
  http.get('http://example.com/api/resource');
  // Injecting sleep
  // Sleep time is 500ms. Total iteration time is sleep + time to finish request.
  sleep(0.5);
}
```

Based upon our test scenario inputs and results:

- The configuration defines 2 stages for a total test duration of 30 seconds.
- Stage 1 ramps up VUs linearly from the 0 to the target of 10 over a 20 second duration.
- From the 10 VUs at the end of stage 1, stage 2 then ramps down VUs linearly to the target of 0 over a 10 second duration.
- Each iteration of the default function is expected to be roughly 515ms, or ~2/s.
- As the number of VUs changes, the iteration rate directly correlates; each addition of a VU increases the rate by about 2 iterations/s, whereas each subtraction of a VUs reduces by about 2 iterations/s.
- The example performed ~300 iterations over the course of the test.

## Glossary

### **VU**

- Virtual User

### **Think Time**

- Amount of time a script stops during test execution to
replicate delays experienced by real users while using an application.

### **Iteration**

- A single execution of the default function in a K6 script.

### **Average Test**

- Assess how the system performs under a typical load for your system or application. Typical load might be a regular day in production or an average timeframe in your daily traffic.

### **Stress Test**

- Help you discover how the system functions with the load at peak traffic.

### **Spike Test**

- A spike test verifies whether the system survives and performs under sudden and massive rushes of utilization.

### **Breakpoint Test**

- Breakpoint tests discover your systemâ€™s limits.

### **Soak Test**

- Soak tests are a variation of the average-load test. The main difference is the test duration. In a soak test, the peak load is usually an average load, but the peak load duration extends several hours or even days.
